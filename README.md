# Line-tracing-bot
The bot uses a Proportional line tracing algorithm (P from PID) to navigate the route (black insulator tape). The setpoint can be varied, and the 'right 'right2'' and 'stopper'implementation were implemented for the purpose of the track it was tested, hence they are subject to change. Any suggestions are recommnded
(3 IR sensors were used)
